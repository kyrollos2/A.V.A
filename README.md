**Overview**
One of the biggest issues facing human space travel is the musculoskeletal decay that results from extended time in microgravity. Astronauts fight the effects of this atrophy with vigorous exercise. However, these same astronauts also must complete their mission objectives, and oftentimes preventative measures can be curtailed by a more pressing matter. Furthermore, astronauts who do keep to the training frequently still return to Earth with weakened musculoskeletal systems. To address this issue, we will implement a virtual ‚Äòassistant‚Äô that will track the astronaut‚Äôs vitals. This assistant will classify the astronaut‚Äôs severity of musculoskeletal atrophy on a scale of ‚ÄòOK‚Äô to severe. This solution will help astronauts have a better understanding of when to prioritize their exercise over the mission.

Implementation: We created a user friendly User Interface, where the medical officer aboard a ship can gain meaningful insights on their patient. We managed the database of patients using mongodb, paired with a Spring Restful API to handle CRUD operations. We also attempted to train a deepforest mode to classify our datasets. We generated fake data sets on a combination of thoroughly researched test markers that usually indicate muscloskeletal atrophy. However, ran into a wall trying to combat biased outputs. We ended up successfully being able to train our data sets using Google Platform's Auto AI. As a note, Auto Ai accepts your input data, and the assigned task (in this case binary classification) and selects a model for you. As this is prorietary technology, they do not allow us to export, or view the technical details of the model assign. Despite thisover the coming weeks we will continued to investigate ways in which we can better preprocess our training data set.
### Research

## üí° Tech Stack

### Front-End Development :üñåÔ∏è

The front-end of MAVA is built with modern web technologies, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience. Key technologies include:
- React
- Html
- CSS

### Back-End Development üêç

The back-end of MAVA handles data processing, authentication, and more. Key technologies include:

- Python Scripts to generate fake data sets
-Java Springboot handle business logic

### ML-Development ü§ñ
1. Split generated data set into training and testing sets
2. Transformers establised to extract the differnce in Male and Female acceptable thresholds. ColumnTransformer applies the combined feautures to the relevant columns in the dataset
3. Data pipe line: Preprocess, and then a random forest classifier learns to map X_train and y_train and the feautures associated with them.
Evaluations: .65 precision, .70 accuracy, .59 recall, .63 F1-Score, 


### Database 

MAVA utilizes a robust database system to store and manage health data efficiently. The chosen database technology is:

- MongoDB: Nonstructured databases is a perfect starting point for our application. 
### Figma Prototyping

Before development, MAVA underwent prototyping using Figma to design the user interface. Figma helps in creating a cohesive and intuitive UI/UX.

### React

React is used to build interactive and dynamic components, making the user experience seamless and efficient.

## üî• Features

- **Deep Forest Classification**: MAVA uses advanced Deep Forest algorithms for precise health assessments.
- **User-Friendly UI**: A simple and intuitive interface makes it easy to input and analyze health data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize health metrics and classification results for informed decision-making.
- **Customization**: Highly customizable for integrating additional indicators and algorithms.
